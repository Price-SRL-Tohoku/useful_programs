# useful_programs
A compilation of some useful programs for later reference.

These programs are not written for a single cohesive purpose. Most can be run independently of the others. This is simply a repository of useful snippets of code I have written or adapted from other works. I try to give credit to the original authors where applicable.

Feel free to use or adapt as desired.
